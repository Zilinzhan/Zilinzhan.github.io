# Biography

I am a third-year Ph.D. Candidate at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU). Here I am lucky enough to work with Prof. [Youfang Lin](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7443/){:target="_blank"} and Prof. [Jing Wang](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9167/){:target="_blank"}. Recently I will conduct my research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a visiting student, under the supervision of Dr. [Roger Mark](http://imes.mit.edu/people/faculty/mark-roger/){:target="_blank"} (IEEE Fellow) and Dr. [Li-wei Lehman](http://web.mit.edu/lilehman/www/){:target="_blank"}.

I strive for developing novel time series data mining, machine learning and deep learning algorithms. In addition, I am also interested in a broad range of physiological time series applications in sleep stage classification, Brain Computer Interface, and affective computing. Besides research, Iâ€™m also an enthusiastic coder. I have participated in some large software development projects, and I am familiar with many tools for processing big data, such as Hadoop, Hbase, Hive, Spark, Flink and Storm.

# Emails

<p style="margin: 0 0 0.5em 0">Like most people, I am struggling to keep up with my email. Here are a few rules that help me handle common situations more efficiently:</p>
  <table style="font-size: 0.9em">
  <tr>
  <td> <strong>Seeking Code and Data</strong> </td>
      <td> I am committed to contributing code and data related to my previous work to the scientific community. Usually, they will be open sourced on my <a href='https://github.com/ziyujia' target='_blank'>Github</a>, but it may take some time to release them. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> <strong>Seeking cooperation</strong> </td>
  <td> I really like working with people with similar backgrounds to complete research projects. If you are interested in cooperating with me in scientific research, please attach your curriculum vitae (CV) to the email. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td> <strong>Review request</strong> </td>
  <td> Like most of us, I receive requests to review papers at a much higher rate than I can possibly handle. As a selection criterion, I tend to accept reviews of papers that fall into my areas of expertise, and from journals and conferences that do not seek to extract excessive financial profit from the work that authors and reviewers provide for free to the scientific community.  </td>
  </tr>
